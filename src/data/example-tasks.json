    "description": "Conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of a specified academic paper. The review process should emulate standard peer-review practices or other review processes. Multiple, distinct peer-review workflows for the provided academic paper. Each workflow should illustrate a unique but comprehensive and systematic process, adhering to established scholarly standards. For every workflow, explicitly address: Actionable Improvement Suggestions. Provide clear, specific feedback on how to enhance the manuscript, such as reworking arguments, refining analyses, or improving clarity and structure. Strengths and Weaknesses: Pinpoint the paper’s most notable contributions as well as areas requiring further development or clarification. Additional Literature, Experiments, or Analyses: Suggest relevant references, new data collection, or alternative methodological approaches if needed. Explicit Recommendation: Conclude with a recommendation (accept, minor revision, major revision, or reject) and a concise statement that justifies your decision using detailed evidence from your analysis. Scholarly Rigor and Relevance: Evaluate the relevance of the research objectives, the appropriateness of the methodology, its rigor and validity, and the originality of the findings. The goal is to generate a range of possible strategies, each offering a clear, thorough path to reviewing and enhancing the paper.",

    "description": "Create engaging, varied, and distinct 25-second video scripts based on the abstract of an academic paper. Each script must adopt a unique storytelling angle or perspective, clearly differentiating itself in style, tone, and narrative structure from other scripts. Every script generated by the flow should include: 1. Captivating Opening: Immediately draw viewers' attention with an intriguing hook related to the paper’s key topic. 2. Clear and Structured Outline: Present a logical flow segmented into distinct parts, each clearly defined and purposeful. 3. Specific Content & Visual Elements: Detail both verbal content and corresponding visual components (animations, graphics, text overlays, etc.) tailored explicitly for each section. 4. Smooth Transitions: Ensure seamless narrative and visual continuity between segments. 5. Precise Timing: Allocate specific durations for each part in the script, ensuring the entire script fits neatly into the 25-second. 6. Compelling Conclusion: Conclude each script memorably, reinforcing the key message or insight derived from the paper. Ensure that each proposed workflow highlights a fresh, compelling approach, making the academic content accessible and engaging to diverse audiences.",

    "description": "Craft a set of taskflows that generate fully executable, diverse, and interactive Python visualizations to tell a compelling data story. The input dataset may contain missing values and multiple attributes, allowing flexibility in selecting and emphasizing specific columns to create engaging narratives. Key Requirements: 1. Visualization Variety: Include at least four and no more than six distinct chart types (e.g., line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, heat maps, etc). 2. Attribute Focus: Deliberately choose and combine attributes (including handling missing data) to highlight unique angles in the narrative.  3. Narrative Integration: Accompany each visualization with clear, insightful text explaining the visual output, its context, and key insights. 4. Cohesive Story Flow: Ensure visual elements and their accompanying text seamlessly connect to form a unified, engaging storyline. 5. Fully Executable Output: Provide structurally sound Python code that can run as-is, delivering an interactive experience and revealing meaningful insights from the dataset. These taskflows should culminate in a polished storytelling experience that leverages both visual and textual components to convey the hidden patterns and takeaways within the partial dataset.",
