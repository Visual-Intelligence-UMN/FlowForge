Let's go through each step:\n\n1. **Load the Data**: We'll use the `pandas` library to load the JSON data into a DataFrame.\n\n2. **Handle Missing Values**: We'll identify columns with missing values and decide on a strategy to handle them, such as filling with default values, dropping, or using imputation methods.\n\n3. **Transform Data**: If necessary, we'll transform data types (e.g., dates) and compute any additional columns that might be useful for analysis.\n\nHere's how you can implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the data into a DataFrame\ndata = [\n    {\"Title\": \"The Land Girls\", \"US Gross\": 146083, \"Worldwide Gross\": 146083, \"US DVD Sales\": None, \"Production Budget\": 8000000, \"Release Date\": \"Jun 12 1998\", \"MPAA Rating\": \"R\", \"Running Time min\": None, \"Distributor\": \"Gramercy\", \"Source\": None, \"Major Genre\": None, \"Creative Type\": None, \"Director\": None, \"Rotten Tomatoes Rating\": None, \"IMDB Rating\": 6.1, \"IMDB Votes\": 1071},\n    {\"Title\": \"First Love, Last Rites\", \"US Gross\": 10876, \"Worldwide Gross\": 10876, \"US DVD Sales\": None, \"Production Budget\": 300000, \"Release Date\": \"Aug 07 1998\", \"MPAA Rating\": \"R\", \"Running Time min\": None, \"Distributor\": \"Strand\", \"Source\": None, \"Major Genre\": \"Drama\", \"Creative Type\": None, \"Director\": None, \"Rotten Tomatoes Rating\": None, \"IMDB Rating\": 6.9, \"IMDB Votes\": 207}\n]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Handle missing values\n# Fill missing 'Running Time min' with a default value, e.g., the mean or a placeholder\ndf['Running Time min'] = df['Running Time min'].fillna(df['Running Time min'].mean())\n\n# Fill missing 'Rotten Tomatoes Rating' with a default value, e.g., the mean or a placeholder\ndf['Rotten Tomatoes Rating'] = df['Rotten Tomatoes Rating'].fillna(df['Rotten Tomatoes Rating'].mean())\n\n# Transform 'Release Date' to datetime\ndf['Release Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Release Date'])\n\n# Check the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Loading Data**: We use `pd.DataFrame(data)` to load the JSON-like data into a DataFrame.\n- **Handling Missing Values**: We fill missing values in 'Running Time min' and 'Rotten Tomatoes Rating' with the mean of the column. If the column is entirely missing, the mean will be `NaN`, so you might want to use a placeholder like `0` or `-1` instead.\n- **Transforming Data**: We convert 'Release Date' to a datetime object for easier manipulation and analysis.\n\nThis setup will prepare your data for further analysis and visualization in a dashboard.

Since the dataset provided contains only two entries with their release dates and US Gross values, we will plot these values to visualize the sales trend.\n\nWe'll use Plotly, a powerful library for creating interactive charts, to achieve this. Here's how you can create a line chart using Plotly:\n\n```python\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Prepare the data for plotting\n# We'll use 'Release Date' as the x-axis and 'US Gross' as the y-axis\ndf_sorted = df.sort_values('Release Date')  # Ensure data is sorted by date\n\n# Create a line chart\nfig = px.line(df_sorted, x='Release Date', y='US Gross', title='Sales Trends Over Time', markers=True)\n\n# Update layout for better readability\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title='Release Date',\n    yaxis_title='US Gross ($)',\n    xaxis=dict(tickformat='%b %Y'),  # Format the x-axis ticks to show month and year\n    yaxis=dict(tickprefix='$'),      # Add dollar sign to y-axis labels\n    hovermode='x unified'            # Show hover information for all points on the same x-axis\n)\n\n# Show the plot\nfig.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting Data**: We sort the DataFrame by 'Release Date' to ensure the line chart plots the data in chronological order.\n- **Creating the Line Chart**: We use `px.line()` from Plotly Express to create a line chart. The `x` parameter is set to 'Release Date', and the `y` parameter is set to 'US Gross'.\n- **Customizing the Chart**: We add markers to the line chart for better visibility of individual data points. The layout is updated to format the x-axis as month and year, add a dollar sign to the y-axis labels, and unify the hover information for better interactivity.\n\nThis line chart will visually represent the sales trends over time for the given dataset.
