This approach minimizes the impact of outliers and maintains the integrity of numeric analysis.\n\n2. **Categorical Columns Handling:**\n   - Columns including **MPAA Rating**, **Distributor**, **Source**, **Major Genre**, **Creative Type**, **Director**, and **Rotten Tomatoes Rating** had missing values filled with their most common (mode) values. This ensures that the categorical data remains representative of the dataset's overall distribution.\n\n#### Example Adjustments:\n- **The Land Girls** and **First Love, Last Rites**: Any missing values in numeric fields were filled with the median, while categorical fields were filled with the mode, e.g., filling missing 'Major Genre' with 'Drama' if it's the most common.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThe cleaned dataset is now primed for detailed visualization tasks that will be executed in parallel. These visualizations will include:\n\n- **Box Plots** for analyzing distribution and variability in production budgets.\n- **Bar Charts** to investigate genre distribution and popular trends.\n- **Scatter Plots** to explore relationships between production budgets and box office performance.\n\nBy synthesizing these diverse visual insights, we aim to generate strategic recommendations for stakeholders in the movie industry, focusing on trends, opportunities, and potential areas for growth.",

This bar chart helps visualize which genres are most and least prevalent in the dataset.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json\",\n  \"description\": \"A bar chart showing the distribution of movies across different genres.\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"url\": \"data/movies.json\"\n  },\n  \"mark\": \"bar\",\n  \"encoding\": {\n    \"x\": {\n      \"field\": \"Major Genre\",\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"axis\": {\n        \"labelAngle\": -45,\n        \"title\": \"Genre\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"y\": {\n      \"aggregate\": \"count\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"title\": \"Number of Movies\"\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"field\": \"Major Genre\",\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"legend\": null\n    }\n  },\n  \"title\": \"Distribution of Movies by Genre\"\n}\n```\n\n**Insight**: The bar chart gives us a snapshot of how genres like *Drama*, *Comedy*, and *Action* have consistently led the pack, while genres such as *Documentary* or *Musical* see much less production. This sets the stage for understanding genre preferences in the industry.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Trend of Most Popular Genres Over the Years\n\nNext, we generated a line chart that explores how genre popularity has changed over time using the ‘Release Date’ and ‘Major Genre’ fields. This chart tracks how often each genre appears each year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json\",\n  \"description\": \"A line chart showing the trend of the most popular genres over the years.\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"url\": \"data/movies.json\"\n  },\n  \"transform\": [\n    {\n      \"calculate\": \"year(datum['Release Date'])\",\n      \"as\": \"Release Year\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"mark\": \"line\",\n  \"encoding\": {\n    \"x\": {\n      \"field\": \"Release Year\",\n      \"type\": \"temporal\",\n      \"title\": \"Year\"\n    },\n    \"y\": {\n      \"aggregate\": \"count\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"title\": \"Number of Movies\"\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"field\": \"Major Genre\",\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"title\": \"Genre\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"title\": \"Trend of Most Popular Genres Over the Years\"\n}\n```\n\n**Insight**: The line chart reveals fascinating ebbs and flows. For instance, *Action* and *Adventure* surged in the 2000s and 2010s, likely paralleling the rise of blockbusters and franchises. Meanwhile, *Drama* held steady throughout, underscoring its perennial relevance.\n\n---\n\n## ⚖️ 3. Scatter Plot of Production Budget vs. IMDB Rating by Genre\n\nTo dive into the relationship between **investment and reception**, we created a scatter plot comparing production budgets to IMDB ratings, with color encoding by genre.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json\",\n  \"description\": \"A scatter plot comparing the production budget versus IMDB rating for each genre.\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"url\": \"data/movies.json\"\n  },\n  \"mark\": \"point\",\n  \"encoding\": {\n    \"x\": {\n      \"field\": \"Production Budget\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"title\": \"Production Budget ($)\"\n    },\n    \"y\": {\n      \"field\": \"IMDB Rating\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"title\": \"IMDB Rating\"\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"field\": \"Major Genre\",\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"title\": \"Genre\"\n    },\n    \"tooltip\": [\n      {\"field\": \"Title\", \"type\": \"nominal\", \"title\": \"Movie Title\"},\n      {\"field\": \"Production Budget\", \"type\": \"quantitative\", \"title\": \"Budget\"},\n      {\"field\": \"IMDB Rating\", \"type\": \"quantitative\", \"title\": \"IMDB Rating\"},\n      {\"field\": \"Major Genre\", \"type\": \"nominal\", \"title\": \"Genre\"}\n    ]\n  },\n  \"title\": \"Scatter Plot of Production Budget vs. IMDB Rating by Genre\"\n}\n```\n\n**Insight**: This visualization reveals a wide spread of investment levels across genres. Some *Drama* and *Comedy* films score high on IMDB despite modest budgets, suggesting strong storytelling resonates with audiences. On the other hand, *Action* and *Sci-Fi* films generally demand bigger budgets—but don't always earn the highest ratings.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: A Unified Genre Narrative\n\nTogether, these visualizations tell a multi-faceted story:\n\n- The **bar chart** roots us in *what* genres are most prevalent.\n- The **line chart** chronicles *how* genre preferences evolved, reacting to cultural, technological, and market shifts.\n- The **scatter plot** explores *why* some genres may outperform others in audience appreciation relative to budgetary input.\n\nIn sum, genres are not just labels—they’re lenses into audience psychology, industry economics, and cultural evolution. Understanding the data behind them empowers creators and studios to make smarter, more resonant storytelling decisions.\n\nLet this be not just a report, but a **script** for where the future of cinema might head next.",

This suggests a central tendency in movie ratings, with fewer movies achieving extremely high or low ratings. This distribution might indicate a general consensus among audiences, where most movies are perceived as average.\n\n#### 2. **Trends Over Time**\nThe line chart illustrating the average IMDB ratings per year provides insights into how movie ratings have evolved. There are noticeable fluctuations, with certain periods showing higher average ratings. This could be reflective of changes in the film industry, such as advancements in technology, storytelling techniques, or shifts in audience preferences.\n\n#### 3. **Budget and Ratings Relationship**\nThe scatter plot examining the relationship between production budgets and IMDB ratings suggests that while there is some correlation between higher budgets and higher ratings, it is not a strong one. This indicates that a larger budget does not necessarily guarantee a better-rated movie. However, there are outliers where low-budget films have achieved high ratings, emphasizing the importance of factors other than budget, such as screenplay, direction, and acting.\n\n#### 4. **Genre and Year Impact on Ratings**\nThe heatmap analysis of average ratings across different genres and production years highlights specific combinations of genres and years that tend to produce higher-rated movies. Certain genres consistently achieve high ratings, while others may fluctuate more dramatically depending on the year. This suggests that genre popularity and audience preferences can shift over time, impacting ratings.\n\n### Key Findings:\n- **Central Tendency in Ratings**: Most movies are rated around the average range, with fewer movies at the extremes.\n- **Temporal Fluctuations**: Movie ratings show notable trends over time, potentially linked to industry changes.\n- **Budget vs. Quality**: High production budgets do not always equate to high ratings, highlighting the role of creative elements.\n- **Genre-Year Dynamics**: Certain genres and years are more likely to produce higher-rated movies, reflecting changing audience tastes.\n\nThis analysis provides a nuanced understanding of the dynamics influencing movie ratings, offering valuable insights for filmmakers, producers, and marketers in the film industry.",

By presenting US Gross in steel blue and Worldwide Gross in orange, we can contrast the domestic and global financial success of movies relative to their budgets. If points tend to rise with increased budget, it suggests a positive correlation, where higher budgets might drive higher gross earnings. However, outliers may indicate instances where high budgets did not translate to expected success, or low-budget films that exceeded expectations. This visualization provides a dual perspective on movie financial performance, offering insights into both domestic and international markets.",
