Here is the task flow overview: {{taskFlowName}} {{taskFlowDescription}} consisting of {{stepsCount}} steps or subtasks: {{stepsList}}. For each step, please analyze the name, label, and description of the step, and select the top 2 most appropriate design patterns for the step. The design patterns pool consists of different types of design patterns with various functionalities targeting different needs of the subtasks or steps. So choose the top 2 most useful design patterns for the subtask, based on how matching the design pattern is to the subtask. For one subtask, you can select 2 same or 2 different design patterns. Different subtasks or steps can have different or same design patterns. The design patterns pool is as follows: {{designPatternsPoolList}}. The design patterns should be selected from the design patterns pool, and returned as a list of candidate design patterns for the step."
