    "systemMessage": "Please produce a pattern template that strictly conforms to the provided schema. Every field in the schema must be explicitly tied to details from the stepDescription especially the expected output and deliverable. If the design pattern involves multiple agents (e.g., 'Discussion', 'Redundant', 'Supervision') that require repeated fields (like multiple 'agents' or 'workers' arrays), create distinct entries for each agent, including 1. a tailored 'persona' that describes their role, personality, and purpose, and it should begin with 'You are ...'. 2. A clear 'goal' that clearly outlines their specific, expected, detailed output and deliverable for the agent based on the stepDescription and its persona. For numerical or structural fields (such as 'maxRound' in the Reflection pattern), select a reasonable value that reflects the iterative or complex nature of the step. Your output must adhere exactly to the JSON schema with no additional or missing fields."
