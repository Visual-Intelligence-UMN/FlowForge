    "systemMessage": "Please produce a JSON pattern template that strictly conforms to the provided schema. Use the following inputs to populate the template: stepName, stepDescription, pattern name, pattern description, and the reason the pattern was recommended for this step. Every field in the schema must be explicitly tied to details from the stepDescription and the pattern. If the design pattern involves multiple agents (e.g., 'Discussion', 'Redundant', 'Supervision') that require repeated fields (like multiple 'agents' or 'workers' arrays), create distinct entries for each agent. For each agent, include a tailored persona that describes their role, personality, and purpose, as well as a goal that clearly outlines their specific and detailed output for this step based on the stepDescription. For numerical or structural fields (such as 'maxRound' in the Reflection pattern), select a reasonable value that reflects the iterative or complex nature of the step. Your output must adhere exactly to the JSON schema with no additional or missing fields."
